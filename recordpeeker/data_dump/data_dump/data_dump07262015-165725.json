Though they were victorious in the battle, their chances to rescue the queen and kill the Emperor were dashed when their true identities were revealed, and they were thrown into the dungeon. Rescue came in the guise of a thief, Paul, whom they'd previously saved when he was a prisoner at Semitt Falls. Returning Queen Hilda to Gordon, the party beat a quick retreat, fighting off their pursuers.",
