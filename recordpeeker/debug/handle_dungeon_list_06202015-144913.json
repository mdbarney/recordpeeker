King Sasune informed the Warriors of Light that Djinn made his fastness in the Sealed Cave, but defeating him would not be simple: the king's daughter, Princess Sara, held the mythril ring they needed to banish the Djinn, and she was nowhere to be found. Fearing she may have been kidnapped by the Djinn, the Warriors of Light hurried to the Sealed Cave to rescue her.",
