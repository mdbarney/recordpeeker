# If ATK â‰¤ 346, then Damage = ((ATK)^1.8)/sqrt(DEF)
# If ATK > 346, then Damage = 2000 * sqrt(ATK)/sqrt(DEF)
# (max hp * sqrt(def))^(1/1.8) = atk
# (max hp * sqrt(def)/2000)^2 = atk


# The base accuracy of an attack is equal to the following:
# (base chance to hit) + Acc * 8/35 - Eva * 6/35
# where base chance to hit = 90, thus:
# 90 + Acc * 8/35 - Eva * 6/35 

# Things to note:
# 	1. This only applies to physical attacks.
# 	2. This chance is then capped between 20% and 100% inclusively.
# 	3. When blinded, your Acc is decreased by 50% (before the calculation).
# 		This occurs after your hit rate is capped at 100% but before the 20% min cap


# Healing spells like Curaga and Prayer use a fairly simple formula with very few additional modifiers. 
# The base formula to determine the amount that is healed is as follows:
# Power * (5 + (Mnd^0.75) * 100 / 256)
 
# This is rounded to the nearest integer value. The baseline Power value for Cure is 30. This means 
# that for someone with 150 Mnd, the amount healed with Cure would be: 
# 30 * (5 + (1500.75) * 100 / 256) = 30 * (5 + 42.86 * 100 / 256) = 30 * 21.74 = 652.28 = 652
